## Tips/Run

* There is a blog-post, [here](https://www.jasongaylord.com/blog/2020/05/28/creating-azure-function-from-command-line), for creating an Azure Function from the .NET CLI, I haven't actioned this project utilising any commands but is something I'll do when I learn more about this technology;

## Errors Experienced

* Abc;

## Notes:

* The Azure Function runs from the following CLI: C:\users\keith\appdata\local\azurefunctionstools\releases\3.14.0\cli_x64\func.exe;
* The default port for running an Azure Function is 7071;
* Calling "http://localhost:7071/api/Function1?name=Keith" resulted in "Hello, Keith. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";

## What's it all about?

* In this article, we are going to discuss how we can simply create an Azure function using Visual Studio 19, and then we will deploy the same function to the Azure function app from Visual Studio;
